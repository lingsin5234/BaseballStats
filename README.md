MLB Stats Website
=================

This repository holds the website that uses the 2010-2016 gamelog files, found at retrosheet.org, to provide users with sortable statistics for viewing.

There are two versions of the parsers because each one is run on different computer. The main differences between the two parsers is just the directories that hold the raw gamelog files.
