Baseball Stats Website
=================

This repository holds the website that uses the 2010-2016 gamelog files, found at retrosheet.org, to provide users with sortable statistics for viewing.

Although this repo was forked from the MLB Stats repo, this has actually rebuilt the stats site from scratch, starting with python wrangling.
